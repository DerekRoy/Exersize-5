This code uses the turtle library in python to create balloons of different colors and pigments.  After importing the turtle library I created global variables to that defined the unique color codes for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and brown. These global string variables were used to feed the pen object within the turtle library in order to change the colors of the flowers as needed. The first function created  is the my ballon function which takes  a turtle object, an x and y co-ordinate, and a radius to create a ballon. The primary role of this function is to create balloons from the point that the turtle left off of when the function was called. The next function is the main procedure that runs the whole program. This function sets up a turtle object and iterates through a while loop that verifies if the user wants to draw balloons, validating the response, entering in to two internal while loops that define the number and color of the balloons, jumps into an if else statement to define the colors, then sets balloon placement variables, and draws them.    The goal of this project was to practice using the turtle module, and to utilize loops and conditional statements.
